For now this is relatively empty, but this is supposed to become a 
small vanilla JS-Library to use for simple expansion of form-fields based on
table-like structures with dynamic adding and removing of form fields.

Usage is simple: 
Bind the relevant structure to a new DynamicForm through it's (hopefully) intuitive configuration and that's it.
